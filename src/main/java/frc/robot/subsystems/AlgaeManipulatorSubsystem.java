/**The Subsystem will make use of three motors to intake, manipulate, and output both algae and coral 
 * the first motor will rotate clockwise and counterclockwise motion to pull in and put out algae:
 *  I intend to make use of positive and negative output values in order to identify motor direction 
 * The second motor will rotate either dirrection to pull in and put out algae and coral 
 * The third motor will swivel to adjust the verticle angle of the entire assembly
